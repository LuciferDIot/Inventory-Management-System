<h1>JavaFX Application Readme</h1>
  
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later</li>
    <li>MongoDB database server</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Setting Up the Application</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone or download the application source code from the repository.</li>
    <li>Open the project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor.</li>
    <li>Import the necessary libraries and dependencies for JavaFX and MongoDB in your project.</li>
    <li>Ensure that the MongoDB server is running locally or accessible via the network. If not, install and configure MongoDB according to your operating system and network environment.</li>
    <li>Create a MongoDB database for the application. You can use the MongoDB command-line interface or a GUI tool like MongoDB Compass to create the database. Choose an appropriate name for your database.</li>
    <li>Implement four tables in the MongoDB database to store the following details:</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>User details</li>
    <li>Stock</li>
    <li>Product</li>
    <li>Categories details</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Define the required fields and structures for each table based on your application's requirements.</p>
  
  <h2>Running the Application</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Build the application, ensuring all dependencies are resolved successfully.</li>
    <li>Run the application from your IDE or command line using the appropriate command or configuration.</li>
    <li>Once the application starts, it should establish a connection with the MongoDB database using the provided connection details.</li>
    <li>If you have followed the setup steps correctly, the "Errors Will Generate Cause of MongoDB Database Not Found" message should no longer appear.</li>
    <li>Use the application's user interface to interact with the various tables and perform the desired operations related to user details, stock, products, and categories.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  <p>If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the application, consider the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure that the MongoDB server is running and accessible.</li>
    <li>Double-check the database connection details in the application code to ensure they match the MongoDB server configuration.</li>
    <li>Verify that the required tables (collections) exist in the MongoDB database with the correct names and structures.</li>
    <li>Check for any error messages or exceptions displayed by the application or in the application logs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the problem persists, consult the application's documentation or seek assistance from the application developer or a knowledgeable community.</p>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>By following the instructions provided in this readme file, you should be able to set up and run the JavaFX application without encountering the "Errors Will Generate Cause of MongoDB Database Not Found" message. Ensure that the MongoDB database is created, and the required tables are implemented to store the necessary details for the application's functionality.</p>
